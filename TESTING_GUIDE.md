## Test Plan 8: Two-Pi HA Failover

### Objective
Validate HA failover between two Pis.

### Prerequisites
- 2 Raspberry Pis on same network
- Both configured with same VIP
- Pi #1 as MASTER, Pi #2 as BACKUP

### Steps

1. **Verify MASTER has VIP:**
   ```bash
   # On Pi #1 (MASTER)
   ip addr show eth0 | grep <VIP>
   # Should show VIP
   ```

2. **Start continuous ping:**
   ```bash
   # From another device
   ping -t <VIP>
   ```

3. **Stop Keepalived on MASTER:**
   ```bash
   # On Pi #1
   docker stop keepalived
   ```

4. **Observe failover:**
   - Ping should continue (maybe 1-2 packets lost)
   - VIP should appear on Pi #2

5. **Verify BACKUP has VIP:**
   ```bash
   # On Pi #2 (BACKUP)
   ip addr show eth0 | grep <VIP>
   # Should now show VIP
   ```

6. **Restart MASTER:**
   ```bash
   # On Pi #1
   docker start keepalived
   ```

7. **Observe fail-back:**
   - VIP should return to Pi #1 (higher priority)

### Success Criteria

- [✓] VIP initially on MASTER
- [✓] Failover occurs within 5 seconds
- [✓] BACKUP takes over VIP
- [✓] DNS continues working during failover
- [✓] Fail-back occurs when MASTER returns

## Regression Tests

### Test existing functionality still works

1. **Verify existing stacks still deploy:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f stacks/observability/docker-compose.yml up -d
   docker compose -f stacks/ai-watchdog/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Verify existing scripts work:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/health-check.sh
   bash scripts/validate-env.sh
   ```

3. **Verify profiles still load:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh profiles/
   cat profiles/standard.yml | head -20
   ```

## Final Validation Checklist

After all tests pass:

- [ ] Documentation is accurate (no broken links)
- [ ] README.md reflects new features
- [ ] All scripts have proper shebangs and permissions
- [ ] Docker Compose files are valid YAML
- [ ] No secrets committed to git
- [ ] Code is commented where complex
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Wizard requires browser** - No headless/CLI-only mode for Level 2
2. **Single language** - UI is English only
3. **No profile customization** - Profiles are pre-defined, not customizable via wizard
4. **No validation for VIP conflicts** - User must ensure VIP is unused

---

## Reporting Issues

When reporting test failures, include:
- Test plan number and name
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs (sanitize passwords!)
- Environment details (Pi model, OS version, network config)

---

## Success Metrics

The implementation is successful if:
- **90%+ of tests pass** on first run
- **Zero critical bugs** (data loss, security issues)
- **Installation takes < 10 minutes** for average user
- **Documentation is clear** and followed by testers
- **Failover works** reliably in HA mode
