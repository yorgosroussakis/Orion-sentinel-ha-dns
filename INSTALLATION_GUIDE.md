## ⚠️ Pi-hole DNS Configuration (IMPORTANT)

> **🔒 Privacy Policy: This project ONLY supports Unbound as upstream DNS provider for Pi-hole.**

Before proceeding with installation, understand this critical privacy requirement:

### Allowed DNS Upstreams

| Provider | Configuration | Privacy Level |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Unbound** (Default) | `127.0.0.1#5335` | 🟢 Maximum - Local recursive resolver |

### NOT Allowed (Privacy Risk)

❌ **DO NOT configure Pi-hole to use these public DNS providers:**
- Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
- Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
- OpenDNS (208.67.222.222)
- Quad9 (9.9.9.9)
- Any other third-party public DNS

### Why This Policy?

Using public DNS resolvers exposes your **entire DNS query history** to third parties. With Unbound:
- DNS queries go directly to authoritative servers
- No single third party sees all your queries
- DNSSEC validation is performed locally
- Complete privacy control

📖 **[Read the full Pi-hole DNS Configuration Guide](docs/PIHOLE_CONFIGURATION.md)** for detailed rationale and configuration instructions.
