# NextDNS over DoT (DNS over TLS) forwarding configuration for Unbound
#
# This file is OPTIONAL. If it exists and is mounted, Unbound will forward
# all DNS queries to NextDNS over TLS instead of performing recursive resolution.
#
# If you want fully local recursive DNS (default), either:
#   - Delete this file, or
#   - Remove/comment the volume mount in compose.yml
#
# To enable NextDNS forwarding:
#   1. Sign up at https://my.nextdns.io
#   2. Get your configuration ID (e.g., abc123)
#   3. Replace <your-id> below with your actual NextDNS ID
#   4. Uncomment the forward-zone block
#
# Your NextDNS endpoints will look like:
#   - 45.90.28.0@853#<your-id>.dns.nextdns.io
#   - 45.90.30.0@853#<your-id>.dns.nextdns.io
#
# See https://my.nextdns.io/setup for your specific endpoints.

    # TLS certificate bundle for validating upstream DoT connections

# Uncomment and configure the forward-zone below to enable NextDNS DoT
# forward-zone:
#     name: "."
#     forward-tls-upstream: yes
#     # Replace <your-id> with your NextDNS configuration ID
#     forward-addr: 45.90.28.0@853#<your-id>.dns.nextdns.io
#     forward-addr: 45.90.30.0@853#<your-id>.dns.nextdns.io
