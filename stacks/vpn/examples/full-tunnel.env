# Full Tunnel VPN Configuration

# Your public IP or DDNS hostname

# DNS server for VPN clients (use Pi-hole)
WG_PEER_DNS=192.168.8.251

# Internal VPN subnet
WG_INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0

# Route ALL traffic through VPN (0.0.0.0/0)

# ===============================================
# Use Case: Full Tunnel
# ===============================================
#
# What this does:
# - All internet traffic goes through your home connection
# - Your public IP appears as your home IP everywhere
# - All DNS queries go through Pi-hole (ad-blocking everywhere)
# - Maximum privacy but potentially slower performance
#
# Best for:
# - Remote work (appear as if you're at home)
# - Public WiFi security
# - Bypassing geo-restrictions
# - Maximum privacy
#
# Configuration in WireGuard-UI:
# When creating a new peer, use:
#   AllowedIPs: 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
#   DNS: 192.168.8.251
#
# Performance considerations:
# - Speed limited by your home upload bandwidth
# - Higher latency for internet access
# - More battery usage on mobile devices
#
# To apply:
# 1. Copy these settings to your .env file
# 2. Run: docker compose -f stacks/vpn/docker-compose.yml up -d
# 3. Create peers in WireGuard-UI with AllowedIPs=0.0.0.0/0
