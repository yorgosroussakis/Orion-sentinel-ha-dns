# Unified Unbound Configuration
# Optimized for Pi-hole + Unbound as a caching forwarder to NextDNS over DoT
# This single config is shared by both primary and secondary instances
#
# DNS Flow: Clients → VIP (Keepalived) → Pi-hole → Unbound → NextDNS over DoT → Internet
#
# Unbound is now a caching forwarder (not a full recursive resolver).
# It forwards all queries to NextDNS using DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for privacy.
# DNSSEC validation and QNAME minimisation remain enabled for security.

# ============================================================================
# NextDNS over DNS-over-TLS (DoT) Forwarding
# ============================================================================
# Unbound forwards all queries to NextDNS over encrypted DoT (port 853).
# This replaces full root recursion with a privacy-friendly upstream.
#
# CONFIGURATION:
# 1. Create a NextDNS profile at https://my.nextdns.io
# 2. Get your profile-specific IPv4/IPv6 endpoints from Setup Guide → Endpoints
# 3. Update the forward-addr lines below with your profile-specific IPs
#
# NOTE: Unbound does not support environment variable substitution natively.
# You must manually update the IP addresses below, or use a templating tool
# (e.g., envsubst) to generate this config from a template if automation is needed.
#
# Default endpoints below are NextDNS Anycast (non-profile-specific).
# For profile-specific filtering and analytics, replace with your assigned IPs.
# ============================================================================
