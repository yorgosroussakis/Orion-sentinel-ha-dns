# Unified Unbound Configuration
# Pi-hole + Unbound as a recursive caching DNS resolver
# This single config is shared by both primary and secondary instances
#
# DNS Flow: Clients → VIP (Keepalived) → Pi-hole → Unbound → Root DNS Servers
#
# Unbound operates as a full recursive resolver, querying authoritative servers directly.
# This provides maximum privacy as no third-party DNS provider sees your queries.
# DNSSEC validation and QNAME minimisation are enabled for security and privacy.

# Root Hints for Recursive Resolution
# ============================================================================
# Unbound operates as a full recursive resolver, querying authoritative DNS
# servers directly starting from the root servers. This provides maximum
# privacy as no third-party DNS provider can log your queries.
#
# The root hints file is included in the Unbound container by default.
# It contains the addresses of the root DNS servers.
