# This directory contains TLS certificates for the DoH/DoT gateway
#
# Generate self-signed certificates:
#   cd stacks/dns/blocky && bash generate-certs.sh dns.mylab.local
#
# Or place your own certificates here:
#   - server.crt: TLS certificate
#   - server.key: TLS private key
#
# Note: server.key and server.crt are git-ignored for security
