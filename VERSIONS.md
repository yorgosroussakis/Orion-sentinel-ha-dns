## Version 2.3.1 (2024-11-17) - Predictive AI Watchdog

### 🤖 AI Watchdog Enhancement

**Added predictive failure analysis with log parsing** - The AI Watchdog now analyzes container logs in real-time to predict and prevent failures before they occur.

#### Key Features Added:
- **Real-Time Log Parsing**: Continuously monitors logs from all containers
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects 8 critical error patterns (OOM, timeouts, config errors, etc.)
- **Failure Prediction**: Analyzes error trends to predict imminent failures
- **Preventive Actions**: Restarts containers proactively before complete failure
- **Smart Thresholds**: 5 errors/min = warning, 10 errors/min = action
- **Error Tracking**: 60-minute sliding window with frequency analysis

#### Error Patterns Detected:
1. OOM Killer - Out of memory conditions
2. DNS Timeout - Resolution failures
3. Connection Refused - Network issues
4. Config Errors - Configuration problems
5. Permission Denied - Access issues
6. Disk Full - Storage exhaustion
7. Network Unreachable - Infrastructure problems
8. Fatal Errors - Critical application errors

#### New API Endpoints:
- `GET /predictions` - Real-time failure predictions for all containers

#### New Prometheus Metrics:
- `ai_watchdog_log_errors_total` - Errors detected by type
- `ai_watchdog_predicted_failures_total` - Predictions made
- `ai_watchdog_preventive_restarts_total` - Preventive actions taken

#### Benefits:
- **Proactive vs Reactive**: Prevents failures instead of reacting to them
- **Reduced Downtime**: ~5 seconds (preventive restart) vs ~45 seconds (crash recovery)
- **Root Cause Visibility**: Know why failures happen
- **Better Reliability**: Catch issues before users notice

#### Files Changed:
- `stacks/ai-watchdog/app.py` - Enhanced with log parsing and prediction engine
- `stacks/ai-watchdog/README.md` - Complete documentation (NEW)

#### 1. YAML Anchors in docker-compose.yml
**Improvement:** Reduced duplication using YAML anchors for common service configurations

**Before:** 190 lines with repeated configuration blocks
**After:** 170 lines (11% reduction) using `x-pihole-common` and `x-unbound-common` anchors

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for common settings
- Easier maintenance - change once, apply everywhere
- Industry-standard Docker Compose pattern
- Consistent configuration across instances

**Example:**
```yaml
x-pihole-common: &pihole-common
  image: pihole/pihole:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  # ... common settings

services:
  pihole_primary:
    <<: *pihole-common  # Inherit common config
```

#### 2. Unified Unbound Configuration
**Improvement:** Consolidated duplicate unbound configs into single shared file

**Old Structure:**
```
stacks/dns/unbound1/unbound.conf  (duplicate)
stacks/dns/unbound2/unbound.conf  (duplicate)
```

**New Structure:**
```
stacks/dns/unbound/unbound.conf  (shared by both instances)
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for DNS configuration
- Easier updates - modify one file instead of two
- Automatic consistency
- Reduced maintenance burden

**Backward Compatibility:** Install script automatically migrates old configs

#### 3. Enhanced Unbound Settings
Added modern best practices from community implementations:

**Privacy Enhancements:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Installation Fails with Password Error
**Problem:** Installation stops with "PIHOLE_PASSWORD is not set or uses default value"

**Solution:**
1. Edit `.env` file: `nano .env`
2. Generate secure passwords:
   ```bash
   # Generate random passwords
   echo "PIHOLE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   echo "GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   echo "VRRP_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 20)"
   ```
3. Replace `CHANGE_ME_REQUIRED` with generated passwords
4. Re-run installation

#### Docker Permission Denied
**Problem:** `permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, or run:
newgrp docker

# Verify
docker ps
```

#### Port 5555 Already in Use
**Problem:** Web UI fails to start - port 5555 in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5555
sudo lsof -ti:5555

# Kill the process
sudo kill $(sudo lsof -ti:5555)

# Or change port in stacks/setup-ui/docker-compose.yml
```

#### ARM64 Compatibility Issues
**Problem:** Containers fail to start on Raspberry Pi 5

**Solution:**
- Ensure using multi-arch images (check `stacks/dns/docker-compose.yml`)
- Unbound should be `klutchell/unbound:latest` not `mvance/unbound-rpi:latest`
- Update images: `docker compose pull`

#### Network Creation Fails
**Problem:** `failed to create macvlan network`

**Solution:**
1. Check interface exists: `ip link show eth0`
2. If using WiFi, change to `wlan0` in `.env`: `NETWORK_INTERFACE=wlan0`
3. Or use bridge network (automatic fallback)

#### Containers Not Starting
**Problem:** Docker containers exit immediately

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose -f stacks/dns/docker-compose.yml logs

# Verify .env passwords are set
grep "CHANGE_ME_REQUIRED" .env

# Check disk space
df -h

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Performance Tuning Tips

#### For Raspberry Pi 4/5 (4GB+ RAM)
Increase Unbound cache in `stacks/dns/unbound1/unbound.conf`:
```yaml
msg-cache-size: 100m
rrset-cache-size: 200m
```

#### For Low-Memory Systems (1-2GB RAM)
Reduce cache sizes:
```yaml
msg-cache-size: 25m
rrset-cache-size: 50m
```

#### For High Query Volume
Increase threads in `unbound.conf`:
```yaml
num-threads: 4
num-queries-per-thread: 8192

### Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Passwords** - Always use strong, unique passwords
2. **Firewall Configuration** - Restrict access to web interfaces:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 80
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 3000
   ```
3. **Regular Updates** - Keep system and containers updated:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Backup Configuration** - Regularly backup `.env` and custom configs
5. **Monitor Logs** - Check for suspicious activity in Grafana
