## Version 2.0.0 (Previous) - Complete Installation Fix

### Overview
Complete fix of all installation issues including Docker networking, environment configuration, and Signal integration.

### Problems Fixed

#### 1. Timezone Configuration
- **Before**: `TZ=America/New_York`
- **After**: `TZ=Europe/Amsterdam` ✅

#### 2. Keepalived Image Not Found
- **Before**: `osinankur/keepalived:latest` (doesn't exist)
- **After**: `osixia/keepalived:2.0.20` ✅

#### 3. DNS Network Configuration Error
- **Error**: Invalid config for network - user specified IP requires subnet
- **Before**: Local bridge network without subnet
- **After**: External macvlan network `dns_net` created by install.sh ✅

#### 4. Network Name Mismatch
- **Before**: `monitoring-network` vs `observability_net`
- **After**: Consistent `observability_net` everywhere ✅

#### 5. Docker Compose Version Warnings
- **Before**: `version: '3.x'` (obsolete syntax)
- **After**: Removed from all compose files ✅

#### 6. .env File Not Found
- **Problem**: docker-compose looks for .env in same directory
- **Solution**: Symlinks created automatically by install.sh
  ```
  /repo-root/.env ✅
  /repo-root/stacks/dns/.env -> ../../.env ✅
  /repo-root/stacks/observability/.env -> ../../.env ✅
  /repo-root/stacks/ai-watchdog/.env -> ../../.env ✅
  ```

#### 7. CallMeBot Dependency
- **Before**: Required third-party CallMeBot with API keys
- **After**: Self-hosted signal-cli-rest-api ✅

### Migration: CallMeBot → signal-cli-rest-api

**New Setup:**
1. Signal setup (one-time, 5 minutes):
   ```bash
   docker exec -it signal-api signal-cli link -n "RPi-DNS-Monitor"
   ```
2. Scan QR code with Signal mobile app
3. Done! Self-hosted, no external dependencies

**Configuration:**
- Signal number in .env: `SIGNAL_SENDER`
- Recipients in .env: `SIGNAL_RECIPIENTS`
- No API keys needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Installation Fails with Password Error
**Problem:** Installation stops with "PIHOLE_PASSWORD is not set or uses default value"

**Solution:**
1. Edit `.env` file: `nano .env`
2. Generate secure passwords:
   ```bash
   # Generate random passwords
   echo "PIHOLE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   echo "GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   echo "VRRP_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 20)"
   ```
3. Replace `CHANGE_ME_REQUIRED` with generated passwords
4. Re-run installation

#### Docker Permission Denied
**Problem:** `permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, or run:
newgrp docker

# Verify
docker ps
```

#### Port 5555 Already in Use
**Problem:** Web UI fails to start - port 5555 in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5555
sudo lsof -ti:5555

# Kill the process
sudo kill $(sudo lsof -ti:5555)

# Or change port in stacks/setup-ui/docker-compose.yml
```

#### ARM64 Compatibility Issues
**Problem:** Containers fail to start on Raspberry Pi 5

**Solution:**
- Ensure using multi-arch images (check `stacks/dns/docker-compose.yml`)
- Unbound should be `klutchell/unbound:latest` not `mvance/unbound-rpi:latest`
- Update images: `docker compose pull`

#### Network Creation Fails
**Problem:** `failed to create macvlan network`

**Solution:**
1. Check interface exists: `ip link show eth0`
2. If using WiFi, change to `wlan0` in `.env`: `NETWORK_INTERFACE=wlan0`
3. Or use bridge network (automatic fallback)

#### Containers Not Starting
**Problem:** Docker containers exit immediately

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose -f stacks/dns/docker-compose.yml logs

# Verify .env passwords are set
grep "CHANGE_ME_REQUIRED" .env

# Check disk space
df -h

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Performance Tuning Tips

#### For Raspberry Pi 4/5 (4GB+ RAM)
Increase Unbound cache in `stacks/dns/unbound1/unbound.conf`:
```yaml
msg-cache-size: 100m
rrset-cache-size: 200m
```

#### For Low-Memory Systems (1-2GB RAM)
Reduce cache sizes:
```yaml
msg-cache-size: 25m
rrset-cache-size: 50m
```

#### For High Query Volume
Increase threads in `unbound.conf`:
```yaml
num-threads: 4
num-queries-per-thread: 8192
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Passwords** - Always use strong, unique passwords
2. **Firewall Configuration** - Restrict access to web interfaces:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 80
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 3000
   ```
3. **Regular Updates** - Keep system and containers updated:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Backup Configuration** - Regularly backup `.env` and custom configs
5. **Monitor Logs** - Check for suspicious activity in Grafana
